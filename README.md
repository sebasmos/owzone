 The goal of this project was to develop a real-time air monitoring and purification system that allows the recording  of multiple air variables through a mobile application that stores them remotely in  the IBM Cloud service. The TLR5 phase design of a low-cost, portable, pre commercial ozonator equipment is also proposed as a vital device in the face of  contamination caused by the COVID-19 virus in Colombia.
